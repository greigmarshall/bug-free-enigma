# Maths in GitHub markdown files
GitHub uses Mathjax to render common $\LaTeX$ notation.

This is often a much clearer way to explain how formulas in your scripts work compared to inline code. It can also make the theory you have used instantly recognisable to others.

For example,
```
When $a \ne 0$, there are two solutions to $(ax^2 + bx + c = 0)$ and they are: 
$$x = {-b \pm \sqrt{b^2-4ac} \over 2a}$$
```
Is rendered as:

When $a \ne 0$, there are two solutions to $(ax^2 + bx + c = 0)$ and they are: 
$$x = {-b \pm \sqrt{b^2-4ac} \over 2a}$$
